  description: "The internet comprises various layers, with the dark web being a segment not indexed by standard search engines. Accessing the dark web typically requires specialized software, with the TOR (The Onion Router) network being the most prevalent. TOR facilitates anonymous communication by routing user traffic through multiple servers (nodes), each adding a layer of encryption, akin to the layers of an onion. While TOR serves as a vital tool for preserving privacy and circumventing censorship, it also provides a haven for illicit activities due to its anonymity features. This duality presents challenges in distinguishing between legitimate use and maliciousÂ activities.",
